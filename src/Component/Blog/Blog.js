                        <p className='p-2'>
                            Maruti Suzuki has restricted itself to just the entry-level SUV segment for many years now. The Brezza has been successful in helping the country’s leading carmaker with enviable presence but it’s surely conspicuous by its absence in the higher SUV segments. The Creta, for instance, has helped Hyundai establish a strong foothold in the C-SUV segment. So far, it’s been the undisputed leader of its category but it looks like Maruti Suzuki will soon try to grab the bull by the horns. Launching this Diwali is the production Maruti YFG, a compact SUV that takes fight straight to the top-selling South Korean. Well, it will even try and outsell the likes of Kia Seltos, Skoda Kushaq and VW Taigun.
